# Practicing-Sass

## Purpose of this Repo
I wanted to learn about Sass/Scss to create more visually appealing UI for my future applications.

## What I learned
Sass has a numerous amount of benefits over plain css.
- Easier to read variables
- Nesting components in css
    - This allows for more readable css files, and makes it much easier to navagate through code
- Separating css code
    - again provides easier navigation
- Mixins
    - allows reuse of css compenents
- Custom params
    - allows mixins to have slight changes w/out changing the whole mixin
- '#extend'
    - this allows for a css component to inherit the original css code
- calculations
    -ex: width: 100% - 20%;
